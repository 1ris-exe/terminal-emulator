v1.1
 
Hi! :)

Thank you for downloading iRis.EXE stems. 
Included in this package are the stems for:

-no poison of my own
-a thousand needles
-guts :)

Stems will be added to this downloadable package as music is released.

As part of my collaborative process, I believe in making my stems essentially "open-source." 
Meaning, I want you to use them. But also, I want to hear what you create, cause it makes me happy and excited to hear what other people create. Please reach out on social media or email at the following:

Instagram: @1Ris.EXE
Twitter: @1Ris_EXE
Email: mad@iris-exe.io

Obviously, if you have suggestions to add to the package or questions, please email me above.
